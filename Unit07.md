**Unit 7: Nonlinear ODEs** <span id="7"></span> 
*This course has concentrated on the properties and solutions of linear
ODEs, but we have also seen methods that apply to the occasional
nonlinear ODE.  While the detailed study of solution methods for
nonlinear ODEs lies beyond the scope of this course, it is worthwhile
looking at a few examples.*

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Find the solution for the Riccati equation.
-   Describe how Nurgaliev’s law can be used to model population
    dynamics.
-   Find the solution for the Lotka-Volterra equation.
-   Describe how nonlinear ordinary differential equations can be used
    to model inverted pendulum dynamics.
-   Describe how nonlinear ordinary differential equations can be used
    to model double pendulum dynamics.
