**Unit 5: Integral Transforms** <span id="5"></span> 
*Integral transforms form another class of tools that can be used to
convert linear differential equations into algebraic equations.  An
integral transform is a mathematical operator that transforms a function
on which it operates into another function through integration over a
kernel.  Often, by applying an integral transform, a complex function
can be represented as a sum of functions (usually known as special
functions) that are simpler to manipulate in the context of the
underlying ODE.  This technique is closely related to the earlier
discussion of power series solutions.*  
  
 *A wide variety of integral transforms find application in the study of
linear differential equations.  One useful feature of integral
transforms is spectral factorization, or the representation of an
arbitrary function as the sum of a series of orthogonal basis
functions.  The differential equation is thereby transformed into an
algebraic problem, which can be solved using linear algebra.  Once the
solution is obtained, the solution to the original problem can be found
by applying an inverse integral transform.  *
