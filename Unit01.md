**Unit 1: Introduction to Ordinary Differential Equations** <span
id="1"></span> 
*In this unit, we will examine ODEs, their use, and their types.  We
will also take a look at some classic ODE-based problems.  While this
course will focus on the solution of linear initial-value problems
expressed as ODEs, you should know the limits and characteristics of the
various classes of ODE as well. *

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student should be able
to:  
-   Define ordinary differential equations.
-   Distinguish ordinary differential equations from other types of
    differential equations.
-   Determine the order of an ordinary differential equation.
-   Classify ordinary differential equations.
-   Identify common errors which arise when attempting to find the
    solution for ordinary differential equations.
-   Apply the superposition principle to find the solution for ordinary
    differential equations.
-   Find the solution for initial value problems.
-   Find the solution for boundary value problems.
